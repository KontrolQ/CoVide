  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in
      animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause
      respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe
      diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus
      causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

    <p>
      COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered
      coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak
      began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="collapsible">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
      throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
      Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel
      unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing
      special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
      becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
      those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
      problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People
      with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="collapsible">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth
      which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These
      droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
      catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their
      eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in
      droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
      This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
      person who is sick.<br />WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways
      COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

    <h4>Protection measures for everyone</h4>
    <p>
      Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health
      authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and
      several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
      have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
      situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can
      reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some
      simple precautions:

      <br />Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
      rub or wash them with soap and water. <br />Why? Washing your hands with
      soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be
      on your hands. <br />Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between
      yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. <br />Why? When someone
      coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
      mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in
      the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the
      disease. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. <br />Why? Hands touch many
      surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer
      the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter
      your body and can make you sick. Make sure you, and the people around you,
      follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
      with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of
      the used tissue immediately. <br />Why? Droplets spread virus. By
      following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from
      viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If
      you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention
      and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
      <br />Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
      information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow
      your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
      facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses
      and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots
      (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible,
      avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have
      diabetes, heart or lung disease. <br />Why? You have a higher chance of
      catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button class="collapsible">How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there
      is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations
      the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places
      around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For
      people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19
      is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action
      every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with
      any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings.
      Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching
      or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and
      transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries.
      Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be
      aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily
      updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.You can see these at

  <button class="collapsible">Should I worry about COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
      children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1
      in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
      normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect
      them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to
      protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost
      among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good
      respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the
      local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on
      travel, movement and gatherings. Learn more about how to protect yourself

    Who is at risk of developing severe illness?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older
      persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high
      blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to
      develop serious illness more often than others.

    Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
      infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work.
      Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of
      COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a
      bacterial infection.

    Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine
      can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication
      with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for
      COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include
      both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide
      updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

  <button class="collapsible">
    Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
      to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive
      care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
      hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible
      vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They
      are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to
      develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most
      effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
      frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or
      tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people
      who are coughing or sneezing.

  </div>
  <button class="collapsible">Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other
      genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was
      more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no
      outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

  <button class="collapsible">Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
      coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face
      mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone
      who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of
      masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.<br />

    How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and
      individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough. Before
      touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and
      water Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. Orient which side
      is the top side (where the metal strip is). Ensure the proper side of the
      mask faces outwards (the coloured side). Place the mask to your face.
      Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape
      of your nose. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
      chin. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind
      the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid
      touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask
      in a closed bin immediately after use. Perform hand hygiene after touching
      or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled,
      wash your hands with soap and water.

    <p>
      The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and
      beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the
      incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around
      five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.

    Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals.
      Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread
      to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and
      MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of
      COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when
      visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and
      surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all
      times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid
      contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked
      animal products.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      We are aware of instances of animals and pets of COVID-19 patients being
      infected with the disease; As the intergovernmental body responsible for
      improving animal health worldwide, the World Organisation for Animal
      Health (OIE) has been developing technical guidance on specialised topics
      related to animal health, dedicated to veterinary services and technical
      experts (including on testing and quarantine); There is a possibility for
      some animals to become infected through close contact with infected
      humans. Further evidence is needed to understand if animals and pets can
      spread the disease; Based on current evidence, human to human transmission
      remains the main driver; It is still too early to say whether cats could
      be the intermediate host in the transmission of the COVID-19.

    How long does the virus survive on surfaces?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
      surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest
      that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19
      virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This
      may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or
      humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected,
      clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself
      and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them
      with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

    Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing
      COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a
      natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus
      most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to
      a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a
      number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs
      to this group, but is less closely related.

  <button class="collapsible">
    How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in
      December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely
      how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2. However,
      SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an
      animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then
      spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2
      jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely
      through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely
      to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal,
      or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.
      Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a
      risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk
      of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing.
